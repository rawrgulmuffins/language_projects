# Notes On Introduction
## FPC
* OSX needs the free pascal compiler which is almost equivilent to turbo pascal.
* http://www.toosquare.com/2014/07/install-pascal-on-os-x/
## Assembly language 
* 68000 code is the assembly language used.
* My Macbook uses X86_64
* TODO: Translate from 68000 to X86_64
* NOTE: Giving up on containing both 68000 code and X86. I'd need to get into
        full ABST or Bytecode in order to make it actually managable.
