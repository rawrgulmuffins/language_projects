# What Is This?
These are a set of projects that are how I start learning the inner workings of
a language. The goal of this repository is to contain a set of simple and known
solutions to problems (web servers, compilers, EBNF parser generators, etc.),
a reference solution in a language I know (currently Python) and a test client.

This test client will contain a set of system level tests that will send
commands to the example program with expected results. These are black box
tests that no nothing of the inner implementation of the program.

Each example program will contain it's own separate test client. View the
README for the project you're interested in on how to modify the test client.

# Why The Same Projects?

The goal is to have a common set of requirements with a common set of reference
tests to compare against against. The hope is that this will simplify both
learning new programming languages and also comparing how they perform against
others.
